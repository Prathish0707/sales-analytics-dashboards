🍕 Pizza Hut Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Power BI Sales Analysis Dashboard created to analyze Pizza Hut sales data and generate meaningful business insights.
The main objective of this project is to understand sales performance, customer demand, and product trends using interactive visualizations.

The dashboard helps stakeholders answer key business questions such as:

How sales are performing over time

Which pizzas are the best sellers

What categories generate the highest revenue

How customer orders vary by time and product

This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using Power BI.

🎯 Business Problem Statement

Pizza Hut operates with a large volume of daily orders and multiple product categories.
Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:

Track sales trends

Identify best and worst performing pizzas

Understand customer ordering behavior

Make data-driven decisions

This dashboard solves that problem by presenting clear KPIs, trends, and comparisons in a single interactive report.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop

Power Query – for data cleaning and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures

Data Modeling

Interactive Visualizations

🗂 Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains Pizza Hut sales information including:

Order details

Pizza names and categories

Quantity sold

Revenue and price details

Date and time of orders

Before building the dashboard, the data was cleaned and prepared to ensure accuracy and consistency.

🔄 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following steps were performed using Power Query:

Removed duplicate and null values

Corrected data types (dates, numbers, text)

Standardized column names

Created derived columns where required

Prepared data for time-based analysis

This ensured the dataset was analysis-ready.

🧮 Data Modeling & DAX Measures

To enable advanced analysis, several DAX measures were created, such as:

Total Revenue

Total Orders

Total Quantity Sold

Average Order Value

Sales by Category

Time-based measures (daily, monthly trends)

These measures allow the dashboard to respond dynamically to filters and slicers.
